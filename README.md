# -RAID-LEVEL-Predictor-using-Machine-Learning
The prediction model of RAID was established based on supervised machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, XGBoost, Decision Tree and KNN along with other classification models. The prediction effect of the model was compared by calculating the accuracies. The significance of this paper is to examine different RAID levels and provide storage solutions to different users of heterogeneous domains.
